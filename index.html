        <p>Howdy! My name is Ryan Mok. I am born and raised in Lincolnwood, IL, which is a northern suburb of Chicago that nearly
            everyone has never heard of. I am the youngest of 4 children, but am often mistaken to be the oldest due to my
            height when compared to my siblings. I tend to spend most of my free time either being with my childhood friends,
            going to the gym, cooking, playing video games, or playing my saxophone.</p>

        <p>I graduated from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2014 where I received my Bachelor's of Fine Arts
            in Music; I was and still am a fairly large music nerd. I was very active in the athletic bands program which
            included a Marching, Volleyball, and Basketball Band that performed at every home game; I joined mostly
            becasue a lot of my friends were also in them. University ensembles aside, I started an ad-hoc ensemble known
            as
            <strong>Sixth Street Brass</strong>. Most of our music can be classified as "riot-jazz", but we also wrote arrangements of
            popular music such as "No-Diggity" by Blackstreet (we found a way to make it work). For the most part I know
            pretty much nothing when it comes to web design and coding, but I'm very determined to learn as much as I possibly
            can!
